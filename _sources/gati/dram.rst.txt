DDR Layout and Access Patterns
##############################

This document presents the patterns in which DDR is accessed by each block
in the architecture.

.. note::

  This layout is subjected to change based on the requirement of the model.

Image is stored in one portion of DDR memory whose start address is pointed by
`image_start_Add`, accumulants start storing at address pointed by
`acc_start_add`. Similarly, final layer outputs in separate portion of memory,
wherein it is partitioned into two segments 'LO Seg-1' and 'LO Seg-2'.  The
start addresses of these segments are pointed by `layer_op_start_add1` and
`layer_op_start_add2`, respectively.  These two segments are accessed in double
buffering scheme, wherein while reading 'LO Seg-1', valid layer output is
written on 'LO Seg-2' and vice-versa. This is due to fact that the input feature
map to the convolution block should be applied multiple times and not be
overriden.

Data Accessing of Various Blocks
********************************

When a valid configuration instruction is available, latch the `address`
provided in the instruction and use it as the base address for accessing DDR. In
each of the subsequent iteration, previous address is added with an offset to
get a new address of DDR. The offset is calculated as

.. math::
  :label: offset

  offset = BURST\_LENGTH << log2(AXI\_DATA\_BYTES)

For Image (im2col) block
========================

At the start of computation of first layer, input feature map is read from the
address pointed by `image_start_Add` (provided in configuration instruction).
For subsequent layers, feature map is read either from `layer_op_start_add1` or
`layer_op_start_add2`. Updates to the DDR access address are thus:

1. When a new layer begins, the DDR address is same as the address present in
   the configuration instruction.

2. In each iteration add the offset (calculated in :eq:`offset`) to get new address.

3. After  :math:`\lceil{\frac{\#Input\_Channels}{\#SA\_Engines}}\rceil`
   iterations, re-initialize the base address of current layer and increment
   kernel counter by 1.

4. After :math:`\lceil{\frac{\#Kernels}{\#SA\_COL}}\rceil` iterations, latch the
   new base address provided in the instruction to compute next layer.

For Weight block
================

At the start of convolution, the base address of weight segment in DDR is
registered. It is always updated by adding the offset (:eq:`offset`).  This is
due to fact that, weights are not reused and stored in continuous locations in
the memory (both for conv and FC).  The data accessing or scheduling is carried
out if weight FIFOs has the status of 'not almost_full (or) empty (or)
almost_empty'.

Similar kind of mechanism can be used for bias block as well, since they are
added with the SA outputs only after finishing the addition of all the
accumulants.

For accumulants block
=====================

`acc_start_add` is the base address from which data is always read. The address is
updated by adding offset until all of the accumulations of a given iteration are
completed. Since the previous accumulants are not used in the current layer, if
a new layer starts at that point, we can store the accumulants again in the same
segment at the base address `acc_start_add`.


For output buffer block
=======================

In the last iteration of a convolution, the data valid signal is enabled, this
implies that the outputs must be stored in either 'LO Seg-1' or 'LO Seg-2' whose
base addresses will be a part of the instruction. In all iterations other than
the last, outputs from the SA are accumulants and they must be stored as
directed in the previous section. In each iteration, address is updated by
adding offset.
