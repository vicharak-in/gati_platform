Dispatch Block
**************

The FPGA to CPU Dispatcher Block facilitates data transfer between the FPGA to
CPU results stored in FPGA's DDR memory. After processing all layers of the
model, this block ensures the seamless dispatch of 256-bit wide data from DDR to
the CPU in 32-bit chunks. It includes mechanisms for request generation, data
conversion, and signaling to indicate operation completion.

When a dispatch_cpu signal is received from the instruction bus, the dispatcher
waits for the layer_done signal from the config block, which indicates that all
layers have been processed and results are ready for dispatch. Upon receiving
the layer_done signal, the dispatcher generates a request to DDR, specifying
the start address, burst length, and a read signal. DDR then begins sending
256-bit wide data from the specified address. The dispatche converts this data
into 32-bit chunks and stores them in a FIFO for retrieval by the CPU. Once the
config_done signal is received from the config block, indicating the final
request,this sends a Start of Frame (SOF), data size, and ID to mark the end of
the operation.

**Dispatch_Flag_Checker** is the block that receives the start address and data
size to be sent to the CPU. It waits for the dispatch_cpu and layer_done
signals, latches the data, concatenates it, and sends it to the FIFO for
storage. The Request_Generator then generates requests to DDR. It waits for
readiness signals from the packetizer and memory_request_controller blocks
before taking data from the FIFO and forwarding it along with a valid request
signal.

**Memory_Request_Controller** handles communication with DDR. Upon receiving a
valid request, it latches the address and data size, sends the 32-bit address
to DDR in 8-bit chunks. It waits for the data_last signal from the data_rd_ctrl
before sending the next request.The packetizer slices incoming 256-bit data
from DDR into 32-bit chunks. It latches the data size and ID upon receiving a
valid request and sends processed data to the FIFO.
 
**Packetizer** monitors the config_done signal and sends a SOF to indicate the
end of the operation alongside data size and ID based on valid signal and
dispatch data through RAH or UART.
